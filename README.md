### Welcome!

⚡ My name is Sandrine (she/her) and I'm a data scientist / computational biologist living in Montreal, QC.

🔭 I studied Quantitative & Computational Biology for both my BSc and MSc, where I fell in love with everything data science applied to biological problems. 

🔍 I'm currently fascinated about the innovative challenges at the intersection of software engineering, bioinformatics and health sciences. I love to contribute to multi-omic solutions on high-dimensional datasets to enable the propulsion of clinical trials, drug discovery and personalized patient therapy.

🌱 I'm also very passionate about scientific communication and education, which is why I've participated in many educational initiatives over the years (and will continue to do so). In another life (or perhaps one day), I would've definitely been a teacher.

👩‍💻 Anyway, this GitHub comprises of side projects & examples showcasing a few of my data science, bioinformatic & general programming skills.

💬 Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions, would like to discuss, or even collaborate on a cool project! I'm always open to new opportunities and connections.
