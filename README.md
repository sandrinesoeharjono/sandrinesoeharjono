## Welcome!

⚡ My name is Sandrine (she/her) and I'm a computational scientist in Montréal, QC.

🔭 I studied Quantitative & Computational Biology for both my BSc and MSc, during which I fell in love with everything related to data science applied to biological problems.

🔍 I'm currently fascinated about the innovative challenges at the intersection of software engineering, bioinformatics and environmental/health sciences. I love to contribute to multi-omic solutions on high-dimensional datasets to enable the propulsion of clinical trials, drug discovery and personalized patient therapy. I've also discovered that software development is ~really~ cool, and am always trying to learn more about it.

🔗 I thrive to help bridge the gap between professionals of different industries, since I strongly believe in harnessing the strength of interdisciplinarity to drive research.

🌱 I'm also very passionate about scientific communication and education, which is why I've participated in many educational initiatives over the years (and will continue to do so). In another life (or perhaps one day), I would've definitely been a teacher.

👩‍💻 Anyway, this GitHub comprises of side projects & examples showcasing a few of my data science, bioinformatic & general programming skills.

💬 Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions, would like to discuss, or even collaborate on a cool project! I'm always open to new opportunities and connections.
